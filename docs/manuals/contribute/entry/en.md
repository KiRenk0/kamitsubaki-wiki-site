## Open the right entry

For a correction, open the entry in the intended content language and use its reader edit action; the editor receives the real source path. To create a record, open the [entry editor](/en/contribute/editor/) from [Contribute](/en/contribute/), then choose New entry from the top File menu. Select the entity type and source language. Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and English are maintained sources; Taiwanese and Hong Kong Traditional Chinese are generated from Simplified Chinese.

“Improve this entry,” the stub notice, and the missing-detail list in the reader open that same entry in the editor; they are not separate submission routes. You can also start a new record from the [encyclopedia directory](/en/database/). Clear filters and check aliases before creating one, since an empty search result does not prove the record is absent.

## Write content and properties

Keep the [complete content and style guide](/en/docs/contribute/format/) open while writing. It preserves the detailed rules for structure, names, prose, sources, dates, media, privacy, multilingual content, recommended entry outlines, and the final checklist. Use the [complete syntax and properties guide](/en/docs/contribute/syntax/) for Markdown, frontmatter, media syntax, and field examples. These are full references, not abbreviated by this chapter.

Search aliases first to avoid duplicate entities. A new stable ID uses lowercase Latin letters, digits, and hyphens and remains the same across languages; display names may differ. Complete the editor's required properties for the chosen type before writing prose. Cover, relationships, performers, and credits belong in Entry properties. A page URL is not a repository file path. A placeholder still needs verified facts and sources; do not fill gaps by guessing.

Use the side-by-side preview and outline to inspect sections and anchors. Insert content with the button or `/` menu; source mode preserves extended syntax. When editing an existing entry, keep valid facts, citations, and unfamiliar markup. Review the diff, image rendering, relationships, and sources before submission.

## Images and attachments

Entry attachments belong to the **GitHub PR path**, not the gallery. Select, drop, or paste PNG/JPEG/WebP originals and record their source. The browser keeps attachments locally until they are submitted with the entry. Current in-site limits are **750 KB per file, eight images, and 4 MB total**; files are not compressed automatically. Upload a larger original through the repository contribution path and reference it in the same PR. Entering an image URL does not upload a file. Repository `public/images/...` becomes website `/images/...`; do not use a local disk path or `/public/images/...` in the page.

## Check and submit

Complete required fields, evidence, preview, relationships, language, and a change explanation. When signed in and the service is available, use **Submit via GitHub PR** and keep the receipt. If submission is marked unavailable, save or export the draft rather than assuming local storage sent it. Review, GitHub merge, and site deployment must all finish before the public entry changes. See [Review and revision](/en/docs/contribute/review/) for returned proposals.

## How metadata affects the site

The former contribution guide's field map still applies in V3. `schemaVersion: 2` is the **metadata protocol**, not the site release number. Choose the entity type in the editor, then supply fields supported by that type; prose alone does not create structured relationships.

| Field | Site behavior | Check before submission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id`, `locale`, `entityType` | Identity, language, and canonical route | Reuse the same ID across source languages; never reuse another entity's ID. |
| `name` or `title` | Heading and directory label | Use a verifiable official name and identify translated names separately. |
| `presentation.image`, `presentation.theme` | Cover, reader background, and local theme | Verify the image URL resolves; color is not evidence. |
| `presentation.morphing` | Image-and-name form selector | Use only for real, separate records in one lineage. |
| `classification.primary`, `classification.additional` | Canonical category and extra discovery paths | Extra categories must not duplicate the article body. |
| `relations`, `performers`, `credits` | Related records and reverse credits | Use stable target IDs and the correct relationship type. |
| `sources`, `license` | Evidence and text license | A text license does not grant rights to media. |
| `contentStatus`, `lifecycle` | Stub/publication and activity state | Leave uncertain dates unknown rather than guessing. |

Use the [classification maintenance guide](/en/docs/develop/content/) and current category data. An entity may have several category entrances but only one canonical entry per language. A new unit member needs a real unit record and `member-of` relationship; membership does not automatically put the person into the individual tier. Use `performers` for track performers and `credits` for production roles. Changing a canonical category or source path needs a redirect review, not just a file move.

## Originals that exceed the in-site attachment limit

The repository upload path from the former image guide applies **only to entry attachments**. Gallery files always use the gallery workspace. Preserve the original bytes and resolution; conversion to WebP is not required.

1. Work in a contribution branch of the site repository. Fork first if you lack write access. Target the maintainer-designated development branch.
2. Upload the original into an appropriate `public/images/` directory with a clear lowercase filename. Verify case and extension. GitHub's web upload limit is 25 MiB per file; the site's static-asset audit also imposes a limit, so ask a maintainer about larger files.
3. Update the matching Markdown in the **same branch and PR**, including creator, source, and grounds for use. Repository `public/images/example.jpg` becomes website `/images/example.jpg`. A local path, `/public/images/...`, temporary `blob:` URL, or GitHub file-view page is not a public image URL.
4. Check Files changed for both the original and Markdown. Check the live entry and image only after merge and deployment; a successful file upload does not publish the page.

An already deployed image can be referenced directly. An image in the same new PR may appear broken in a production-based preview until deployment. Prefer a new filename for replacement and search covers, body text, and other languages before removing the old file. Generated thumbnails do not replace originals.

## Final submission checklist

- Search aliases and other language versions; compare the primary category with the detailed map.
- Verify factual claims, dates, quotes, and images against traceable sources; mark uncertainty explicitly.
- Preserve correct old prose, unfamiliar syntax, and citations; inspect the diff for accidental removal.
- Preview headings, anchors, image URLs, target IDs, and multilingual identity.
- Keep the receipt ID. If none appears, check Creator Center before opening another PR.
